## üö© Problem Statement

Electric Vehicles are becoming a crucial part of the sustainable transport ecosystem.

The main challenges addressed in this project:

- Understanding the adoption rate of EVs over time
- Identifying top EV manufacturers and models
- Analyzing geographical distribution of EVs
- Studying EV range trends and preferences
- Providing visual insights for stakeholders

## üîë Key Metrics

- Total Vehicles: 150,413
- Total BEV Vehicles: 116,745 (77.6%)
- Total PHEV Vehicles: 33,668 (22.4%)
- Average Electric Range: 67.83 miles
- CAFV Eligible Vehicles: 62,887 (41.8%)

## üîç Visual Insights

- Top EV Manufacturers: Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet dominate the market.
- Top EV Models: Tesla Model Y, Model 3, and Nissan Leaf are the most popular.
- Geographic Distribution: High EV adoption in Washington, California, and nearby regions.
- CAFV Analysis: Nearly half of the EVs have unknown CAFV eligibility status.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- Programming: Python üêç
- Excel: For initial data cleaning and preparation.
- Tableau: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Environment: Google Colab Notebook

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Analysis

- Removed duplicates and null values.
- Standardized EV types into BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle).
- Extracted numeric values from range fields.
- Grouped and aggregated data by state, make, and model.

## üìä Visual Highlights

- Tesla accounts for 52% of EV adoption, showcasing its market dominance.
- Washington state shows the highest EV concentration.
- Average EV range is improving but still varies widely by model.
- CAFV data highlights policy-driven incentives‚Äô impact on EV ownership.

## üéØ Next Steps / Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following insights and recommendations were derived:

- Promote High-Performing EV Models: Focus on top-selling EV brands and models that show consistent adoption. Encourage their market presence through incentives, promotions, or collaborations with manufacturers.
- Address Low Adoption Regions: Identify states/cities with lower EV registrations. Investigate barriers such as lack of charging infrastructure or awareness, and implement location-specific awareness campaigns and infrastructure investments.
- Encourage Long-Range EV Adoption: Insights show that newer EV models offer better ranges. Promote these models through policy support, subsidies, and campaigns to attract consumers looking for reliability in long-distance travel.
- Charging Infrastructure Expansion: Geographical analysis highlights areas with rising adoption. Prioritize setting up charging stations in these hotspots to sustain growth and enhance convenience.
- Customer Preference Analysis: Utilize brand and vehicle type distribution to understand whether consumers prefer BEVs or PHEVs, and align marketing and policy strategies accordingly.
